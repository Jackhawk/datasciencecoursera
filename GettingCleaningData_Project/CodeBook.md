###Project Description


The purpose of this project was to demonstrate ability to collect, work with and clean a data set.  The project goal was to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.


The raw data was produced from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data

Raw data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)


###Notes on the original (raw) data 

**List of the raw data files**

```
./UCI HAR Dataset
  activity_labels.txt		# list of activities with activity_id
  features_info.txt			# description of how variables were created
  features.txt				# list of all variable names
  README.txt				# describes the data and processes applied
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/
    ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals # not used for this project
    subject_test.txt		# list of subject_id for the test data
    X_test.txt				# the test data 
    y_test.txt				# activity_id for the test data
  ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/
    ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals # not used for this project
    subject_train.txt		# list of subject_id for the test data
    X_train.txt				# the test data
    y_train.txt				# activity_id for the test data
```
These two subfolders and their content were ignored for the purpose of this project

* ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals

* ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Inertial Signals

The UCI data was randomly split into two sets

* The **test** dataset contains 30% of the data
* The **train** dataset contains 70% of the data

The original test and train data files contain 561 variables and a total of 10,299 observations over the combined test and train data files.

Each set of observations are made for 30 different subjects undertaking 6 different activities:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

See the file "features_info.txt" for a full description of the the variables.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Cleaning script process

**High level description of the process taken**

1. Download the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (as above)

2. Read data to the R workspace

   * train dataset

   * test dataset

   * features.txt

   * activity_labels.txt

3. Merge the datasets, add variable names and activity labels

4. Create a subset of the merged data that contains

    * the activty labels

    * the subject_id

    * only those variables that were calculated for mean and standard deviation

5. Create the tidy data file that provides the mean of each variable grouped by "Activity" and "Subject_id"

###The script

**"run_analysis.R"**

The script follows steps 2 to 5 above, it will read the appropriate data files, apply the necessary process and then write a tidy data file to your R working directory - "tidydata.txt"


The [readme file](https://github.com/Jackhawk/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/GettingCleaningData_Project/README.md) contains detailed instructions for how to use the script.

##Description of the variables in the "tidydata.txt" file 


General description of the file:


  - 180 observations of 68 variables

  - V1 - "Activity" - chr - contains the activity label for each observation

  - V2 - "Subject" - int - contains the subject id for each observation

  - V3:68 "mean and std" - num - contains the the average of the original mean and std variables
